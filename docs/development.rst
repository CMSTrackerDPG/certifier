Development
===========

Prerequisites
-------------

-  git
-  python3
-  Django Tutorial

In case one wants to improve the Certhelper project, the following
steps are necessary:

-  Install Python version 3.8
-  Setup a virtual environment
-  Install requirements packages

Installing Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python can be downloaded on https://www.python.org/ or via package
managers on a linux distribution. Python (3.4+) should come bundled with
pip and virtualenv, so everything necessary should be ready to use.

**Windows**:

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

**Ubuntu or Ubuntu based distributions**:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt install python3

**Arch Linux or Arch based distributions:**

Use an `AUR helper`_ like `yay`_ and install `python36`_

.. code:: bash

   yay -S python/pacman -S python

If you do not want to use an AUR helper you can install Python 3.6
`manually`_ with:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-git/
   cd python-git
   makepkg -si

.. _AUR helper: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers
.. _yay: https://github.com/Jguer/yay
.. _python36: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python36/
.. _manually: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages

Checking Python Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project requires the python version 3.8. To ensure that the
correct python version is configured the ``python3 --version`` command
be used.

.. code:: bash

    python3 --version

.. code:: bash

    Python 3.8.1

Cloning the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/CMSTrackerDPG/certifier
    cd certifier

Setup Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to develop in a isolated virtual environment to ensure
the correct package versions and avoid conflicts with other projects.

.. code:: bash

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

After executing these commands a ``(venv)`` should precede the command
line.

Installing Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requirements files contain every python package that is necessary in
order to deploy the website. Each line consists of one single python
package which can be a link to a GitHub repository or the package name
and version which are registered in the `pypi <https://pypi.org/>`__
repository. Since there are additional packages used exclusively for
testing, which are not necessary in the production environment an
additional testing-requirements.txt file exists.

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r testing-requirements.txt

Configure database connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The credentials are read from environment variables which have to be set
accordingly.

In case one wants to work with a local SQLDatabase while developing then
following environment variables should be exported.

.. code:: bash

    DJANGO_DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.sqlite3
    DJANGO_DEBUG=True
    DJANGO_DATABASE_NAME=db.sqlite3
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=(%g65bg+&9rbnt+h&txlxw$+lkq=g=yrp!6@v+7@&$a%9^yt-!

In case one wants to work with the development database (used in
``dev-certhelper.web.cern.ch``) following environment variables have to be
exported:

.. code:: bash

    DJANGO_DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
    DJANGO_DATABASE_NAME=<your database name>
    DJANGO_DATABASE_USER=<your username>
    DJANGO_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your password>
    DJANGO_DATABASE_HOST=<your database host name>
    DJANGO_DATABASE_PORT=6600
    DJANGO_DEBUG=True
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=p*3y)jem=g8gj)6g_qy_6opfrwg2px^+((56y02l^pqz#!gitz

Alternatively a ``.env`` file with the content above can be created.

The DJANGO\_SECRET\_KEY key stated here serve just as examples and
should not be used anywhere outside of the local development. For a
production environment, the secret key should never be visible to the
outside world and can be generated with tools like:
https://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/

These environment variables are read in the settings.py module which
configures the database.

Load sample data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When running the project from a development database as was setup above, you will probably
need some data to play with. This is done via `Django fixtures <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/initial-data/>`__,
which are written by hand in the ``certifier.yaml`` file in ``certifier/fixtures``. 

To load them, activate the virtual environment and run:

.. code:: bash
		  
   python manage.py loaddata certifier.yaml

Alternatively, ``factory_boy`` can be used, by calling the custom management command ``fake_data``.
For example, to populate the database with a default superuser and some
fake data, run the following:

.. code:: bash

		  python manage.py fake_data

To recreate random entries, navigate to the admin interface, delete all ``test<num>`` users and re-run
the aforementioned management command

Another option (by Peter):

.. code:: python

		  # Create fake entries
		  import pytest
		  from mixer.backend.django import mixer
		  pytestmark = pytest.mark.django_db

		  mixer.blend("oms.OmsFill")
		  mixer.blend("oms.OmsRun")
		  mixer.blend("oms.OmsRun")

		  mixer.blend("certifier.RunReconstruction")
		  my_run_certification = mixer.blend("certifier.TrackerCertification")

		  
Packages

The *requirements.txt* should always be updated when adding new
packages.

Testing Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **pytest-cov**: Create coverage reports when running pytest
-  **pytest-django**: Easy Django integration for pytest
-  **mixer**: Fast and convenient way of creating model instances for
   unit tests
-  **selenium**: Necessary to run functional tests (with firefox)
- **codecov**: Generate code test coverage raport

All packages that are used in a testing environment should be stated in
the *testing-requirements.txt* file.

Branches
--------

Master
~~~~~~

The master branch is the production branch. It is used to deploy to
certhelper.web.cern.ch via OpenShift. This branch should only contain
stable and tested code. Changes should never be made directly in the
master branch.

Training
~~~~~~~~
The `training` branch serves as a separate project, which deploys
independantly, using a different database so that Shifters can train
without interfering with the production one.

Code changes to the `master` branch include:

- Fetches all runs from RunRegistry, not just open ones (see `openruns/utilities.py`)
- Visual cues to easily differentiate the apps

.. note::

   Every time an important update is pushed to `master`, the changes
   should also be merged to the `training` branch

   .. code:: bash

		git fetch -a
		git checkout training
		git merge master
		git push origin training


   Some of the changes *will* lead to conflicts upon merge.


Develop
~~~~~~~
.. warning::

   Deprecated

Development branch to test new features before deploying it to the
production website. Commits in the development branch are automatically
deployed to ``dev-certhelper.web.cern.ch`` every time changes are pushed to
GitHub.

.. note::

   This is no longer available, because the PaaS link that triggers the build
   cannot be accessed from outside of CERN (i.e. from a GitHub webhook)

.. code:: bash

    git push origin develop

When a develop branch is thoroughly tested and ready for production then
it can be merged into the master branch:

.. code:: bash

    git checkout master
    git merge develop
    git push origin master

Feature branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When developing new features or working on bugfixes, a new branch should be created.

.. code:: bash

    # for new features
    git checkout -b feature-mynewfeature master

	# for specific issues, e.g. issue 108
	git checkout -b "#108" master

After the new changes have been committed, they can be merged back into
the master branch.

.. code:: bash

	git checkout master
	git merge --no-ff feature-mynewfeature  # --no-ff can be clearer for historic reasons, preserving commits on a separate "branch"
	git commit -m "Merging feature mynewfeature"
	git branch -d feature-mynewfeature
	git push origin master

The push to `master` branch automatically triggers the unit tests
at Travis CI.

Django Tutorial
---------------

It is recommended to the finish the Django tutorial at
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/ before doing
any changes at the website. The tutorial is beneficial and gives a big
overview of how Django works.

Style Guide
-----------

To improve readability of the source code, a consistent style guide
should be used. The python files are all formatted with the Black Code
Formatter

The black code formatter can be installed on the local machine via

.. code:: bash

    pip install black

The project files can then be reformated with

.. code:: bash

    black [FILES...]


Run the website locally
-----------------------
1. Create a file named ``.env`` with the required configuration (See `Configure database connection`_).
   You should also include the variables ``OMS_CLIENT_ID``, ``OMS_CLIENT_SECRET``, which can take any value
   since they will only exist as placeholders when running locally.
   
2. Run:

.. code:: bash
   
   python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
   python manage.py runserver

3. [Optional] If you need to test tracker map generation, you will also need to have Redis locally.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install redis-server

In ``settings.py``:
	
.. code:: python
		  
   CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer",
        "CONFIG": {"hosts": [("127.0.0.1", 6379)]},
	   }
	}



Migrations
----------

Whenever you make changes to ``models.py`` you should run the ``makemigrations`` command.

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py makemigrations

The migrations can then be applied with:

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py migrate


Documentation
-------------

If you want to contribute to the documentation that is hosted at
`readthedocs`_ you should get familiar with Spinx and reStructedText

-  https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html
-  http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html

To generate a local documentation these commands have to be run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install sphinx
   cd docs
   make html

After that you can open the ``index.html`` file that is located at
``docs/_build/html``.

.. _readthedocs: https://tkdqmdoctor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
