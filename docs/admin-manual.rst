Administration manual
=====================

The administrator has the most power in the website. He can create new
(local) users and is responsible for maintaining the website. He can
update or create the OAuth2 keys, which are necessary for CERN Single
sign-on.

The admin panel of the administrator consists of all of the same rights
that a shift leader has plus additional settings that for site
management.

.. note::
