Overview
========

The Certhelper, also referred to as the "Certification helper", is a tool used by Shifters and Shift Leaders at the Tracker DQM.

The primary goals of this tool are to improve the quality of data certification by providing automatic shift summaries and validation, as well as automatic form data collection for most of the needed fields.
